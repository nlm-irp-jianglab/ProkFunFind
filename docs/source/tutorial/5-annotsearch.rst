*****************************
Annotation-based Searches
*****************************

This tutorial section focuses on performing searches based on precomputed
annotation data for a genome. These methods allow you to take an annotation
file for a genome of interest and perform searches on that using common
annotation features including KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers, Clusters of
Orthologous genes (COGs) identifiers, and protein domain IDs.

This section of the tutorial will focus on how to run searches for
each kind of annotation feature individually, but they can be mixed
together as well to allow for more complex searches. These type of
mixed query searches are covered in the :doc:`Mixed Search <./6-mixedsearch>` tutorial section.

Protein Domain-Based Searches
#############################
Protein domains are structural or functional regions of a larger protein. Knowing
what domains are present on a predicted protein can provide valuable clues about
what that proteins functions might be. Similarly, searching for protein domains
within the proteins predicted for a genome can help with the idenfication of
specific genes and pathways.

In ProkFunFind we currently support annotations of protein domains using the
`InterProScan <https://interproscan-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
ProkFunFind can incoperate these annotations in the tsv output format from
InterProScan. An example of InterProScan output for the tutorial genomes can
be seen in the `./genomes/GTDB18040_InterProScan.tsv`:

.. code-block::

This format consists of multiple columns, but the essential ones
for ProkFunFind are going to be column 1, the protein accession, and column 5,
the domain signature ID. ProkFunFind supports searching by any of the domain
signature types reported by InterProScan.

Queries
*******
The query files for this search are included in the `./queries/ipr-search/`
directory. Protein domain signatures are provided as the search terms for
this kind of search.

.. code-block::

- name: Equol Production Pathway
  presence: essential
  components:
  - geneID: DZNR
    description: Daidzein reductase
    presence: essential
    terms:
    - id: PTHR42917
      method: interproscan


As described in the :doc:`Queries <./3-queries>` tutorial section, multiple domains can be associated with one gene ID by
providing them on entries in the yaml structure.

Search
******
The domain-based search can be run with the following command from the base
directory of the tutorial repository.

.. code-block::

  prokfunfind -f queries/ipr-search/config.yaml -g ./genome-list.tsv --outputprefix ./out/ipr-search/ipr

The output printed to the screen summarizes the overall presence and absence of
different components in the function definition:

.. code-block::

  INFO:root:Checking configuration files
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Detected function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB18040
  1 out of 1 essential components present
  3 out of 3 nonessential components present
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Detected function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB26128
  1 out of 1 essential components present
  3 out of 3 nonessential components present

In this search we find that both genomes have all components of the function
detected. If you have done the previous tutorial section related to
:doc:`Sequence-based Searches <4-seqsearch>` then you will have seen that these
genes actually do not appear to be present in the second, GTDB16128, genome.
The reason why these results differ when basing the search largely off of PFAM
domains is that a domain-based search can be less specific than a sequence or
profile based search. Multiple different proteins can have the same domain,
especially when dealing with domains that are related to common functions like
cofactor binding or dehydrogenase functions. In the next section we will take
look at the search output and see if there are any clues about that we could
use to interpret this result.

Output
******
In this example we searched for a set of genes related to a the production
of the metabolite equol. It is often common for genes related to the same
function to be found in the same region of the genome, and based on what is
known about the equol production genes this is true for this set of genes.
We can use this information to help parse through the search results and
get a better idea of if we actually find the gene cluster in both genomes.

The best output to look at for this is going to be the `./out/ipr-search/*.tsv`
outputs. Specifically you want to look at the clusters that the genes are put
into in this output.Â ProkFunFind uses the DBSCAN algorithm to cluster putative
gene hits into groups on the genome. This grouping is based on the distance
(in number of genes) between two putative hits, meaning that genes that the
clusters that are determined are made of up genes that are in close proximity
to each other.

If you look at the `./out/ipr-search/ipr.GTDB18040.tsv` you will see the cluster
information in the second column. This cluster information gives the
contig ID of the genome assembly and the cluster ID. Genes with the
ID Cl_NA were not found to be part of a cluster. The other clusters are assinged
numerical IDs based on the order they are present in the genome.

The clusters identified in the GTDB18040 tend to be small, consisting of only
3 to four genes in many cases. But There is one cluster that consists of
all 15 genes from the search:

  GCF_000478885.1_02281	GCF_000478885.1_1:Cl_35	Equol Gene Cluster/other genes/DEVR

In contrast when looking at the output for the GTDB26128 genome,
`./out/ipr-search/ipr.GTDB26128.tsv`, you can see that a majority of the
clusters are small and even the largest ones like Cl_28 consist of multiple hits
to the same genes. This provides an indication that despite putative hits to
all of the genes being identified, there do not seem to be any 'real' looking
clusters.

The use of this clustering information to identify high quality putative hits
is highly dependent on the features being searched. While genes being in the
same gene cluster can be an indication of related function, this is not always
true. Many metabolic pathways consist of genes that are not found in the
same gene cluster, so your interpretation of these results may vary based on
your scientific question.


KEGG Orthology-Based Searches
#############################
The KEGG database groups genes into manually defined functional ortholog groups.
The KO database has become a popular resource to link genes to their functions
within larger metabolic pathways and subsystems. For more information on the
KO database see `KEGG Ortholog <https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html>`_.

In ProkFunFind the KO assignments are parsed from KofamScan tabular output. An
example of this output for the tutorial genomes can be seen in `./genomes/GTDB18040.kofam.tsv`:

.. code-block::

   *	GCF_000478885.1_00001	K02313	130.33	443.5	1.7e-133	"chromosomal replication initiator protein"
  	  GCF_000478885.1_00001	K10763	171.70	89.6	2.1e-26	"DnaA-homolog protein"
  	  GCF_000478885.1_00001	K02315	138.67	64.8	8.1e-19	"DNA replication protein DnaC"


Queries
*******
KO based searches are done using KO identifiers as search terms. More information
on how KO identifiers are assigned and full references of all KO identifiers please
see the KEGG database here: `KEGG <https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html>`_.

For this query KO identifiers for each of the components of the equol gene clusters
were assigned KO identifiers. This can be seen in the
`configuration.yaml` function definition section:

.. code-block::

  - name: Equol Production Pathway
    presence: essential
    components:
    - geneID: DZNR
      description: Daidzein reductase
      presence: essential
      terms:
      - id: K00219
        method: kofamscan
  ...

Not all of the genes being used in the query for this tutorial are have great
matches to the current KO groups defined by KEGG. Because of this you also have
to make the search a little more lenient by adjusting the threshold filtering
property in the `./queries/kofam-search/config.ini` `[kofamscan]` section:

.. code-block::

    ---
    main:
      cluster_tool: DBSCAN
      faa_suffix: .faa
      gff_suffix: .gff
      fna_suffix: .fna
    DBSCAN:
      cluster_eps: 4
      cluster_min_samples: 2
    kofamscan:
      annot_suffix: .kofam.tsv
      threshold: 0.5


For the KO assignment in kofamscan, a match score is calculated for each gene
to KO pair. This score is then compared to an predetermined score for
each KO. The threshold parameter allows you to adjust that score requirement.
The score will be multiplied by the value provided in the threshold argument,
requiring either a higher or lower score for a KO assignment. In this case
setting the threhsold parameter to 0.5 would make the score half as strict.
This score threshold and the evalue parameter may need to be adjusted in
different searches to fine tune your search, especially when there are not
great KO matches for your genes of interest.

Search
******

The KO based search can be done from the root directory of the tutorial
repository using the following command.

.. code-block::

  prokfunfind -f queries/kofam-search/config.yaml -g ./genome-list.tsv --outputprefix ./out/kofam-search/kofam


Based on this search we can detect all four components in the first genome,
but only the three non-essential components in the second genome:

.. code-block::

  INFO:root:Checking configuration files
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Detected function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB18040

  3 out of 3 nonessential components present
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Failed to detect function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB26128
  0 out of 1 essential components present
  3 out of 3 nonessential components present

Output
******

The output for this type of search is the same as the other approaches providing
information about the putative gene hits and clusters of genes found during the
search.

COG-Based Searches
##################

ProkFunFind also supports searching by Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs). COGs
are widely used ortholog groupings. For ProkFunFind searches we use EGGNog-mapper
as the annotation tool to assign COGs. The pregenerated output for this tutorial
can be seen in the `./genomes/*.emapper.annotations` files:

.. code-block::

The orthology assignments in this output can be seen in the fifth column of the output.
This column gives ortholog assignments at different taxonomic levels in this output
and any of these IDs can be used to search through ProkFunFind.

Query
*****
Similar to the KO-based search, the COG based searches define the queries based on the ortholog IDs, in
this case COG IDs. The search term input can be found in the function definition section of the `config.yaml` file:

.. code-block::

- name: Equol Production Pathway
  presence: essential
  components:
  - geneID: DZNR
    description: Daidzein reductase
    presence: essential
    terms:
    - id: COG1902
      method: emapper
      evalue: 1e-100

Similarly to the KO-based search, many of the queries in this example search do not have great COG
matches, so a mix of COGs and ortholog groups at higher levels are used in this search.

Additionally, because ortholog groups can have varying levels of specificity and our search terms are
not perfect matches to each COG group this search will be performed using an additional search term
specific filtering file. This filtering can be applied through the default values in the
configuration section of the `config.yaml` file and individual settings for each search term can be set
directly in the function definition:

.. code-block::

- geneID: DZNR
  description: Daidzein reductase
  presence: essential
  terms:
  - id: COG1902
    method: emapper
    evalue: 1e-100

In this example an evalue filter of 1e-100 is set for COG1902 meaning that only
hits with e-values less than 1e-100 for the prediction will be considered.

Search
******
The search can be performed using the following command:

.. code-block::

  prokfunfind -f queries/emap-search/config.yaml -g ./genome-list.tsv --outputprefix ./out/emap-search/emap

Based on this search it can be seen that the components of the function were detected
in both genomes:

.. code-block::

  INFO:root:Checking configuration files
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Detected function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB18040
  1 out of 1 essential components present
  3 out of 3 nonessential components present
  INFO:root:Searching for function
  INFO:root:Identifying gene clusters
  INFO:root:Summarizing function presence and genes
  Detected function: Equol Gene Cluster in genome ./genomes//GTDB26128
  1 out of 1 essential components present
  3 out of 3 nonessential components present

What happens is similar to the issue seen in the domain-based
search, where we have non-specific hits to additional genes in the second genome.
You can check the tsv or GFF output in the `./out/emap-search/` directory to
confirm this by looking for larger clusters of putative hits on both genomes.
This does highlight one of the benefits of using the ProkFunFind search tool to
perform mixed searches using combinations of different approaches. A walkthrough
on how to set up and run those searches can be found in the :doc:`6-mixedsearch`
tutorial section.
