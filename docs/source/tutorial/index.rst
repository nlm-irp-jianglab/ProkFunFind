ProkFunFind Tutorial
====================

The purpose of this tutorial is to walk you through the process of setting up
and executing searches using the ProkFunFind tool. The tutorial will use the
example of searching for a gene cluster that encodes the metabolic pathway for
Equol production (for the actual study where we analyzed this gene cluster
see PMID: 35247986).

**Tutorial Requirements**

The tutorial materials have been packaged into their own git repository: URL # ADD GIT REPO LINK
The tutorial materials include all of the input and output files that are needed
or would be generated while running the tutorial steps. It has also been designed
to be modular, so each tutorial section can be run on its own without going
through any of the other sections first.

At minimum you will need to install ProkFunFind and download the tutorial
materials to run a majority of the sections. The ProkFunAnnotate tutorial
covers how to use our annotation pipeline and requires multiple additional
programs to be installed and configured. All of the information related to
installation of ProkFunAnnotate and ProkFunFind and the setup of the tutorial
materials can be found in the "Installation and Materials" tutorial section.
